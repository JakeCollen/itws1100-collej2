        </h5>

        <p>
            The first thing we did in Lab 1 was create a VM through Microsoft Azure to act as our file servers. We set up GitHub accounts to link to our Azure VMs. We used Microsoft Terminal to access the VM and to set up a location to hold our personal websites. After that, we created a few folders for our website which are the class root folder and a security key folder. Now that our websites were set up, we created our first webpage. As every first-time developer does, we made a page in html that said "Hello World!" Going back to the security key folder, we put our website behind password protection for authenticated users. Now to GitHub. We created a repository to hold our root folder for the website. Finally, GitHub, our local machines, and our VMs were all linked together.
